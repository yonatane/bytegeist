Binary protocol specs for clojure

WIP

### Current goals
1. [Malli](https://github.com/metosin/malli)-like flexible data-driven specs for byte codecs
2. Support multiple protocol versions easily by basing one version on another
3. Protobuf compatibility without generating code, emphasizing rapid prototyping over performance.

### Previous work
[Octet](https://github.com/funcool/octet) is a great tool and bytegeist basic internals draw from it.<br>
